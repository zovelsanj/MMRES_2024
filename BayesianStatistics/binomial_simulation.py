    #NOTE: Always try with different PRIORS. It is always to good to be dominated by data: Even if prioirs are unfair a good quality of data can
    # genereate a fair conclusion. However, the choice of prioir will always affect the posterior (although the conclusion isn't affected much).
    # A biased prioir will generate a biased posterior.
    #This is not important for large N: with a large data set, the choice of non-informative prior does not matter, as we would expect, since the data should dominate the inference. 
    # For small samples, however, the constraining power of the data is not as strong and the choice of prior does matter.
