# MMRES_2024
Statistical Data Analysis course works for Masters in Multidisciplinary Research in Experimental Sciences batch 2024, at the University of Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

## Python Bootcamp

The Python Bootcamp is a 4-week course that introduces the basics of Python programming to students with no prior programming experience. 
The course is designed to provide a solid foundation in Python programming, covering topics such as variables, data types, loops, functions, data visualization, and basic statistical analysis. 
The BIST repository containing the materials and exercises for the course can be found [here](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2024).

## Statistical Data Analysis
This course is an introduction to the principles of statistical data analysis, with a focus on the application of these principles to experimental sciences. 
The course covers the basics of statistics and probability theory, distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, linear models, and statistical inference. It also includes a group work on the analysis of the [Misophonia dataset](https://github.com/MMRES-PyBootcamp/MMRES-python-bootcamp2024/blob/master/datasets/misophonia_data.csv).

The course book for statistical data analysis theory by **Alejandro Caceres** can be found [here](https://alejandro-isglobal.github.io/SDA/).

## Machine Learning Basics
This course introduces the basics of machine learning, covering topics such as linear models, decision trees, clustering, PyTorch basics, Fundamental elements of a Neural Network, Perceptrons (Single and Multi Layer), and supervised and unsupervised learning, and generative models.
